# Student Management System â€” Next.js/React

A full-stack **web application** for managing students, instructors, courses, sections, registration, and grade submission. Built with **Next.js/React**.  

This project was completed in **two phases**:  
- Phase 1: JSON-based storage & basic features.  
- Phase 2: Database with Prisma + advanced statistics & authentication.

## âœ¨ Features

### Phase 1 (Foundations)
- User login (from `users.json`).  
- Course search (by name or category).  
- Student registration with prerequisite checks.  
- Learning path view.  
- Admin: validate/cancel courses, create new courses.  
- Instructor: submit student grades.  

### Phase 2 (Advanced)
- Designed **relational data model** with Prisma.  
- Migrated JSON â†’ relational database (SQLite/Postgres/Oracle).  
- Implemented repositories with **DB-side filtering/aggregation**.  
- Added **REST APIs** and **Next.js Server Actions**.  
- Built **analytics/statistics dashboard** (10+ queries: e.g., top courses, failure rates, totals per year).  
- Implemented **authentication** (username/password + GitHub/Google OAuth).
